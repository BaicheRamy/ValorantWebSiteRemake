# Valorant Website remake

VALORANT is a free-to-play first-person tactical shooter video game being developed and published by Riot Games. The game currently runs on Unreal Engine 4.

It was announced on October 15, 2019 under the codename "Project A", until it was officially revealed as VALORANT on March 2, 2020. It was officially released on June 2nd, 2020 for PC.

We tried to do a remake for the officiel website of the game [https://playvalorant.com/en-us/] while changing many of the stuff. You can find here all the sources and files that we used/worked-on.
