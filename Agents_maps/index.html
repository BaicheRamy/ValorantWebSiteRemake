            <h2>CREATIVITY IS YOUR GREATEST WEAPON.</h2>
            <h3>More than guns and bullets, youâ€™ll choose an Agent armed with adaptive, swift, and lethal abilities that create opportunities to let your gunplay shine. No two Agents play alike, just as no two highlight reels will look the same. Agents are
                the playable characters in VALORANT, representing an agent of the VALORANT Protocol. Each agent serves as a different class with four abilities and has a unique contract.
            </h3>

            <h3>
                Each agent fulfills one of four roles, defined by their abilities and playstyle: Controllers are experts in slicing up dangerous territory to set their team up for success.<br> Duelists are self-sufficient fraggers who their team expects,
                through abilities and skills, to get high frags and seek out engagements first.<br> Initiators challenge angles by setting up their team to enter contested ground and push defenders away.<br> Sentinels are defensive experts who can lock
                down areas and watch flanks, both on attacker and defender rounds.<br>

            <h3>
                Each match of VALORANT takes place on a map. Maps feature a spawn area for each team, barriers that limit accessible areas during the Buy Phase, and objective sites where the spike is to be planted.<br> Four maps were available at launch,
                and a 6 month cycle is expected for the release of new maps.<br> There are currently six playable maps in VALORANT, with an additional one for practice and training new players.<br>
